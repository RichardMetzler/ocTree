Since this work focuses on the impact that being immersed in an interactive virtual reality scene has on human attention when focusing and performing tasks on 3D objects, this sectin will be subdivided into two parts.
First, publications discussing \textit{mesh saliency}, a commonly used term to describe regional perceived importance of digital representations of real-world objects will be presented and briefly described. The second section will provide a look into human behavior, based on cognition and outside stimuli in virtual reality environments. Both of these sets of scientific works will provide a solid knowledge of terms and methods commonly used in this field and describe the current state of the art.

\section{Mesh saliency}

What human perception guides us to focus our attention on when presented a 3D representation of an object has been extensively researched during the last decade and before that. One commonly cited publication in this field is Lee et al. [\cite{lee2005mesh}]. Based on low-level human visual attention, it introduces the term \textit{mesh saliency}, a measure for regional based importance of 3D meshes and also presents a way to compute it. This fully automatic process successfully predicts  what would be classified as prominent, visually interesting regions on a mesh, thus allowing mesh operations such as simplification [\cite{cignoni1998comparison}] and segmentation [\cite{shamir2008survey}] to produce results that are more appealing to the beholder.
The model for computing \textit{mesh saliency} is based on a center-surround comparison of local curvature. It is scale-dependent on a \textit{saliency factor} $\varepsilon$, which is based on the diagonal of the objects bounding box, and is able to identify salient features of a mesh, depending on their surrounding area. Geometrically complex regions, for example a large patch containing lots of bumps of similar size, will be rightfully dismissed as, in most cases, regions that are not interesting from a human perceptional stance.

The concept of \textit{mesh saliency} has since been refined, augmented and adapted to serve as a basis for a multitude of specific use-cases and applications. When processing single vertex saliency, Chong et al. [\cite{wu2013mesh}] took into consideration not only the curvature of the region surrounding the vertex, but also the global context of it. In other words, for each vertex to be attributed a value describing its saliency, its \textit{global rarity}, derived from comparing its features to those of every other vertex of the object, is computed. They performed a user study in which they had participants choose one out of two saliency maps for a set of objects, presented in a random order. One map was generated using their approach, the other one with the model presented in Lee et al. Participants were asked to pick the one that was a closer representation of what they would have considered interesting regions and features. Since their method got picked in almost 58 per cent of cases, while the results produced by the model presented in Lee et al. only were favored in about 42 per cent, this can be considered a true improvement of the way \textit{mesh saliency} can be computed.

To further reassure the practical relevance of taking perception based mesh manipulation, Howlett et al. [\cite{howlett2005predicting}] conducted a user study...
