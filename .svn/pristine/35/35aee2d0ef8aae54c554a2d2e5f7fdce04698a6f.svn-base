key contents:
- extend concept of Mesh Saliency to deformable objects
- construct vertex-level saliency map that accurately cptures the regions of high perceptual importance over a range fo mesh poses or deformations
- multip-pose saliency := multi-scale aggregate of curvature values over locally stable vertex neighborhoods
- apply Mesh Saliency to the problem of mesh segmentation and view-dependent rendering

Multi-Pose Mesh Saliency
- Mesh Saliency extended to cover deformable meshes with multiple poses
- input: original mesh, set of key deformations or poses
- output: scalar multi-pose saliency map

Saliency-Guided Mesh Segmentation
- Mesh segmentation = cornerstone of object manipulation, parameterization, analysis..
- Most processes, even those that try to detect prominent features, do so with little to no regard of their perceptual importance; available techniques that do, usuaully require user input
- combining mesh saliency with mesh segmentation => partition of meshes into sets of face clusters representing perceptually interesting features
