\chapter{Introduction}

Beginning in the 1950s, virtual reality technology [\cite{steuer1992defining}] has been continuously researched and improved and its professional relevance is becoming ever more present today. There is an plentitude of recent works showing that it bears great potential and positive possible contributions to architecture and construction [\cite{sampaio2014application}, \cite{le2015social}, \cite{stouffs2013happening}], healthcare and psychotherapy [\cite{baus2014moving}, \cite{merians2014rehabilitation}, \cite{de2014healthcare}], engineering and industrial design [\cite{marks2014towards}, \cite{wendrich2016hybrid}] and education [\cite{merchant2014effectiveness}, \cite{ott2015literature}, \cite{thorsteinsson2013developing}]. One must also consider that this technology can help gaining new insights and open up new perspectives into greater, more abstract matters of social, environmental and economic manner [\cite{ovtcharova2015innovation}, \cite{nguyen2016applying}].

With resources such as memory and compute power getting more and more available at an ever-increasing rate, 3D objects and their mesh representations are constantly growing in complexity and size, in terms of shaders, texture maps as well as the sheer number of vertices, as well. Still, many professional applications revolving around interaction with such models require means of displaying them in real-time without significant perceived loss of quality to ensure a smooth and fast workflow. This is where mesh simplification and segmentation plays an important role [\cite{wei2010feature}], [\cite{shaffer2001efficient}], [\cite{zhao2012saliency}] etc.

This issue becomes even more pressing in a professional, commercial context where access to state of the art, high-performance graphic processing units or render farms is not a given for everybody. With less computing power available, means of user-oriented, real-time rendering are of vital importance to a fast and unimpeded way of working on 3 dimensional assets.

Little has been done so far concerning research on \textit{mesh saliency} on a vertex level in a virtual reality environment. Whether saliency maps computed via known methods affect user behavior immersed in VR scenes at all or to which extent has not been investigated in a object manipulation scenario. Furthermore, as of now, the effect on perceived visual quality of saliency-based object simplification as well as user behavior when given the opportunity to declare salient regions themselves is barely touched on at all.
