Algorithm "Fast Marching Watersheds"
segments meshes into visual parts based on human vision theory called the minima rule.

minima rule: defines contures of negative curvatures as visual part boundaries.

contributions of this paper:
- robust hill climbing algorithm for watershed-segmentation on a triangle mesh data structure
- definition of a directional height map appropriate for the minima rule using local principle curvatures
- application of morphological operations to improve the initial marker set for the watersher algorithm

"range image selection: abundance of literature"
"mesh segmentation only recently became interesting"

3D triangle mesh = collection of triangles and vertices approximating a 3D surface.
Mesh segmentation = partitioning of a mesh into more visually meaningful regions or parts.

state of the art:
- Mangan and Whitaker
	- coins the term mesh segmentation
	- propose implementation of watershed segmentation from image processing
- Wu and Levine
	- alternative algorithm based on simulated distribution of electrical charge acress the surface of a mesh
	- loosely based on the minima rule
- Limitations of the state of the art:
	- Wu and Levine's algorithm is not true to the minimal rule
	- genus-one topology, no dents on the surface and the object must have at least one part boundary
The algorithm proposed in this paper does not need these premises to be fulfilled.


Algorithm:
- estimates principal curvatures and principal directions for each vertex
- central aspects: grow() function and heap: positive curvature keys bubble to the top, negative ones sink tot he bottom
