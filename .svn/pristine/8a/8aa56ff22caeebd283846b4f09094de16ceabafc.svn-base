key contents:
- extend concept of Mesh Saliency to deformable objects
- construct vertex-level saliency map that accurately captures the regions of high perceptual importance over a range fo mesh poses or deformations
- multip-pose saliency := multi-scale aggregate of curvature values over locally stable vertex neighborhoods
- apply Mesh Saliency to the problem of mesh segmentation and view-dependent rendering

Multi-Pose Mesh Saliency
- Mesh Saliency extended to cover deformable meshes with multiple poses
- input: original mesh, set of key deformations or poses
- output: scalar multi-pose saliency map

Saliency-Guided Mesh Segmentation (p. 24)
- Mesh segmentation = cornerstone of object manipulation, parameterization, analysis..
- Most processes, even those that try to detect prominent features, do so with little to no regard of their perceptual importance; available techniques that do, usuaully require user input
- combining mesh saliency with mesh segmentation => partition of meshes into sets of face clusters representing perceptually interesting features

Saliency-guided view-depended rendering steps: (p. 27)
	- saliency computation (according to Lee et al.)
	- salient clustering
	- estimate cluster importance
	- rendering of multi-resolution mesh

Contributions -> Improvised single-pose mesh saliency:
	geodesic distance, instead of Euclidean
Contributions -> Multi-pose mesh saliency:
	single saliency map over several deformations
Contributions -> Multi-pose simplification:
	using edge collapses, based on calculated multi-pose mesh saliency
Contributions -> Salient clustering
	saliency used as measure of perceptual importance; used to determine cluster
	starting points and propagation
Contributions -> Multi-resolution salient simplification
	saliency-guided QSlim, weighted by cluster-localized saliency maps
Contributions -> Saliency-guided view-depended rendering
	resolution is preserved for clusters with high estimated saliecny AND visiblity

- "saliency bottom-up / top-down"
	- bottom-up:	based in pixel/vertex information
	- top-down:	based on a given task

Single-Pose Mesh Saliency (p. 35)
- recent techniques: mostly rely on local curvature or user input etc
- visual attention models: (p.35)
	- two-component framewrk where scenes are analysed for interesting objects
	bottom-up and top-down (image-/task-oriented manner)
	- feature contrast matters most in early stages of bottom-up attention (not
	feature strength)
	- most models agree: center-surround analysis is essentila for seperating
	salient regions

Saliency Overview (p. 37):
short, insightful explanation of Mesh Saliency

Geodesic Saliency (. 38):
- calculate geodesic distance (parameterized over mesh edges)
- propagation stops when distance esceends the lmit of desired local neighborhood

Multi-Pose Mesh Saliency (p. 39):
- mesh saliency, being based on *local* curvature, may generate false/incomplete results for deformed or skeletally animated objects
- input: base Mesh, set of al key poses
	- per-pose saliency computation:
	computation of mesh saliency maps using geodesic distance
	- Multi-pose mesh saleincy computation:
	obtained by combining all per-pose saliency values
		- base saliency of a vertex i := lowest saliency of i in all per-pose maps
		- multi-pose saliency = sum (saliency in pose-map - base) for all pose-maps

Multi-pose Salient Simplifcation (40):
- extend QSlim method by wieghting error quadrics

- user guided simplification: weight map : multi-pose saliency!

Salient Clustering:
- faces in one cluster share spatial proximity and orientation etc.
- Seed initialization:
	- sampling from regions of highest importance
	- randomly chose, from each cluster, a user-defined number of vertices
	- all faces that share a seed vertex are placed on cluster propagation queue
- Cluster growth:
	- works Dijkastra-like, performed simultaneously for all clusters
	- Each search starts on highest-saliency face in the queue; subsequent faces are
	evaluated through cost function that considers
		- normal deviation
		- distance variaten
		- saliency variation
	- promotes fairly planar clusters
	- growth proceeds until all faces are assigned to a cluster
- Cluster re-seeding:
	- each cluster has seed and initial data updated
	- new seeds: most interior high-saliency vertex possible
	- new seeds are also selectres thorugh Dijkstra seach, starting from faces located at the
	cluster border and advancing indwards
	- edge cost := combination of distance and saliency variation
- Convergence
	- successive growth and re-seeding phases
	- repeated until new seeds are identical to encountered on previous iteration

Cluster-level Properties:
total saliency, mean saliency, peak saliency, base saliency, total area, mean normal, peak normal

Multi-resulution salient simplification:
- generate multi-res. representations of a clustered mesh
- saliency can be considred QSlims quadric weighting factor in QSlim
- globally important details are better preserved

View-dependent rendering (51)
