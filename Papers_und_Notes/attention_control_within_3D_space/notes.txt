questions tackled in this:
- can human attention be focused on a single depth plane?
- is it possible to search a color singleton within an attended depth plane without interference from singletons in ohter
depth planes?
- is it possible for an element to pop out in one depth plane without any interference from salient elements in other depth planes? 

Experiment 1:
- participants were shown 12 randomly tilted (+/-20Â°) green lines in the frontal plane and 12 green lines in the back plane on a screen
- a green outline rectangle was shown for 100ms around the plane that would contain the red line with 80% probabilty (visual cue; the red line line appeared in the other plane in 20% of cases)
- 1 randomly element turned red for 100 ms
- the entire scene was only shown for 1.5 seconds 
- participants were asked whether the element was in the front or the back plane
- Results:
	- participants were faster and made fewer errors when the target line appeared in cued plane
	- this suggests that attention could be and was focused on the cued depth plane
	- it takes the same amount of time to shift attention from the front to the back plane and vice versa

Experiment 2:
- very similar to experiment 1; the goal was to find out whether searching for a target in a cued plane would prevent attentional capture from singletons (with the same color) in another plane
- 12 lines were shown in a front plane, 12 other lines in a back plane; a 100% correct cue in which plane the red line would appear was given
- lines were tilted randomly or perfectly vertical
- participants had to search for a tilted, red line and ignore the vertical one
- 3 conditions: no distractor; distractor in the same depth plane; distractor in antoher depth plane
- Results:
	- distractor in another plane caused significantly less distraction than distractor in the same plane
	- directing attention to a specific plane does not prevent attentional capture from a singleton presented in another (nonattended) plane 

Experiment 3:
- was aimed at ensuring that participants really were paying attention to cued depth plane
- setup and procedure very similar to experiment 2
- instead of changing the color of the target and the distractor, the color of every non-target line was changed (red -> green)
- Results:
	- similar to results of experiment 2
	- directing attention to a particular depth plane could not prevent capture from a singleton from anpther depth plane

Experiment 4:
- setup and proceducre very similar toe experiment 2
- non-target lines remained grey, target- and distractor-line were green/red
- Results:
	- when distracting singleton appeared in the same plane as the target did, there was interference
	- when distracting singleton appeared in another plane, there was no more interference
