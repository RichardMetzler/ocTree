- existing simplification algorithms: very low LoD: visual appearance of the original is not preserved
- method in this paper is absed on quadric based simplification algorithm (1997)
- 2 main tools: adaptive simplification and geometric constraints
- quadric for each vertex: sum of fundamental quadrics (formed by unit normal and offset of its incident faces)

- key idea: guide simplification by manipulating the quadric associated with each vertex

adaptive weighting of quadrics:
- during simplification, areas with heavey weights have higher contraction costs
-edge contractions in those areas are delayed and the regions maintain higher LoD
