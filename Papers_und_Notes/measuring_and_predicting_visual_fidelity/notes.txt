- polygonal models growing steadily in complexity -> need for visual quality control!
- interactive computer graphics abbplications need fidelity of displayed scenes to be adjusted in real time
- less interactive applications need models to be simplified (containing fewer polygons while preserving visual appearance
- image generators must preserve appearance while reducing image size

experiment:
- naming time, rating, preference fidelity measures
	- goals: learna bout relative strengths and weaknesses of these measures
	- provide an experimental test for evaluation of automatic fidelity measures
- 34 3D polygonal models, none contained color, texture, vertex or normal information
- half of the objects were man-made, the other half were animals
- resulting independed variables:
	- simplification type (Vclust / Qslim)
	- simplification level (3 levels including unsimplified)
	- object type (animals/artifacts)
- participants were shown pictures of objects, varying in above 3 variables
- participants were aksed to name shown objects as quickly and accurately as they could
- participants were aksed to rate each object at every simplification level

results:
- all 3 factors affected performance
- animals were named more slowly than artifacts, naming times were longer with increasing simplification
- naming times were longer with Vclust
- automatic fidelity measures correlate to naming times
- Qslim is by all measures a more effective simplicifaction tool than Vclust
