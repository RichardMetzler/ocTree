- focuses on depth information and depth maps
- doesn't treat them as "just another image channel"
- constructs 3D-layout and shape features exclusively from depth information
- no learning required, works on scenes on which the system has no previous knowledge
- existing methods mostly work based on color and texture while more or less ignoring depth

- depth make it possible to seperate objects which may be similar in appearance

Thesis:
depth is a fundamentally different source of information and correct exploitation of depth will change the computation of saliencies

Approach:
- in general: extract panes (walls, floor, surfaces) to enhance the saliency of parts of these planes
- compute feature vectors for each pixel of an image
- design depth-based features which can be extracted at each image site
- determine how to measure the dissimilarity feature vectors at multiple scales

Results:
- dataset: 80 color and depth images of real-world home invironment
- using depth-features produced better results than priviously known state of the art approaches:
	- ceter surround with depth information
	- context-aware saliency
	- graph-based visual saliency
	- image signature
- better results = more objects recognized, less background falsely identified as objects
