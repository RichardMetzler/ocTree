- focuses on vision in robotics as part of a bigger system
- robotic taskts considered for this paper include manipulation, grasping and tracking
- goal: A system that segments objects that can be picked up, or if it's cluttered, detect good initial grasp points

- uses a Kinect-sensor to generate a RGB-D image database containing
	- isolated free-standing objects (IFSO)
	- occluded objects (OO)
	- objects placed in a box (BO)
	- a box containing objects and sorrunded by other objects (BOSO)
- investigated cues (derived from preattentive human vision):
	- surface height
	- relative surface orientation
	- occluded edges
- these 3 and ther combination was used to pick seed points for segmentation of objects
